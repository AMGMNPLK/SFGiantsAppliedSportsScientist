> [!tldr]
> I have some engineering skills

In my career in [[Innovation in sports science\|Innovation in sports science]] I saw that the best strategy is to bet for the technology. For this reason and because of my passion for engineering I expanded my knowledge to the STEAM field.

I learn about how to innovate through technology, how to code, math, machine learning, statistics,  data science, I started my first company about software for coaches (Sukan) and later I created another one about AI for sports, [[The first AI for sports training design on acyclic sports\|The first AI for sports training design on acyclic sports]] (Dairus).

I managed teams and cooperated with our Chief Technological Officer to work together with all engineers.

Apart from being able to develop software solutions, another motivation for me to learn computer science was to speak the same language as the engineers.

Now I can say that, besides being able to talk to them, I am practically one of them, although I have my respect and admiration for them and I am aware of my limitations.

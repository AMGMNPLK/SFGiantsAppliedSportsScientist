## The person

Experience working as a team with sports scientist and professionals

I always try to look for new ways to do things better.

I learned that the best strategy, even for the most egoistical person is not risk your integrity and reputation and lead others to play this win-win game.

As an educator, coach, manager and entrepreneur I worked on developing skills for effective communication.

I discovered that my mission was helping other to succeed.

My current English level is C1.

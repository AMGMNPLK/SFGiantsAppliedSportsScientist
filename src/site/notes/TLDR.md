# Top 1 in Physical Activity and Sports Sciences
In the Bachelor's Degree in Physical Activity and Sports Sciences at the [University of Basque Country - UPV/EHU](https://www.ehu.eus/es/web/hezkuntza-eta-kirol-fakultatea) one of the most demanding in Spain, I was awarded as:
- TOP 1
- Extraordinary Award to the Best Academic Records

In this Degree I was trained in the Sciences of Physical Activity and Sport that can be applied to all kinds of sport, but I also had some specializations in different sports such as [[My trajectory in Pelota\|pelota]], [[Planning in soccer\|soccer]], [[Planning in tennis,tennis\|Planning in tennis,tennis]], [[Planning for Richard Oribe\|swimming]], [[volleyball\|volleyball]], so I have already made the adaptation of Sports Sciences to different sports.

Moreover, I did [[Planning in soccer\|Planning in soccer]], [[Planning for Richard Oribe\|planning in swimming]] and in [[Adapted Pelota\|Adapted Pelota]].

This Master's Degree has few vacancies and is in great demand by professionals from all Spanish-speaking countries, so they are very demanding in choosing the most deserving students.

Besides learning from some of the best professors, scientists and specialists, I was able to share these lessons with many of the best coaches of different sports as classmates.  
  
I was also able to live from inside this institution how the Olympics work, feel the Olympic spirit, attend some of the events about the organization, experiences, athletes' lives, masterclasses and specialized symposiums as extracurricular activities.

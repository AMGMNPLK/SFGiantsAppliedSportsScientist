> I have a background in statistics

I was trained in statistics in the [[Coursed Master's Degree in High Performance Trainning in Spanish Olympic Committee\|Master's Degree in High Performance Training]] but developed further when I studied mathematics for machine learning by Imperial College London and on my own.

I also did all the courses from Kahn Academy about related mathematics and statistics and many courses of Udemy, Coursera, Youtube...

I have also been working hard on mathematics at [[The first AI for sports training design on acyclic sports\|Dairus]]. In any case, I would like to know more about what level of statistics you are demanding to know if I can be of help.

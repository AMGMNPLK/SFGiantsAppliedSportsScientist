- Only an insignificant fraction of the data that affects performance is gathered.
- The methods are not always based on science and even science is limited in extracting knowledge as it has to work with very isolated variables and usually in very small populations.
- The tools are very archaic, such as spreadsheets and generic databases that requiere more work to get a good enough session than the work they try to save.
- The human mind cannot handle all the variables that affect performance. We, as humans, are forced to prioritize a few variables to look at and reject the others.

> I live in the edge of the sports science

I love being on the cutting edge of sports science and technology. So much so that my own startup is at the forefront of sportstech. 

So, because of my current job, I am up to date with what is happening in sports technology and have relationships with many of the founders of these startups.

In the purest part about sports science I must mention my past as a researcher in sports science and the [[Coursed Master's Degree in High Performance Trainning in Spanish Olympic Committee\|Master's Degree in High Performance Trainning]] where we were working with the latest research, even accompanied by many of the researchers themselves as teachers.

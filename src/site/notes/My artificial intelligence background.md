My background on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) was based on the courses and books by the Stanford University Professor Andrew Ng, the David Silver from Deepmind, Andrew Barto and Richard S. Sutton from University of Massachusetts Amherst, GEA group from University of Extremadura, José Luis Iglesias Feria and other MOOCs from Coursera,  Deeplearning.ai, Udemy, Udacity, Khan Academy, lazyprogrammer.me, 3Blue1Brown...

Even I could learn fuzzy logic from Andrés Soto (PhD, professor in multiples universities and +40 years of experience) while we researched together.

I studied AI techniques like:
- General
	- k-neighbors
	- k-Means
	- Clustering
	- Logic
	- Fuzzy Logic
	- Decision trees
	- Graph search
	- Markov
	- ExpectiMax
	- MiniMax
	- Genetic Algorithms
	- Linear regression
	- Probabilistic inference
	- Likelihood
	- Bayesian
	- Expert systems
- Machine learning
	- Neural networks
	- Random forest
	- SVM
	- PCA
	- XGBoost
- Deep learning
	- CNN
	- LSTM
	- RNN
	- GANs
	- GCN
	- Unsupervised
	- Supervised
	- Se
	- Reinforcement
		- Online
		- Offline

> I developed trainings for isolated and grouped players

I developed training for individual players and also for players who had groups to train. In addition, I also developed training plans for teams.

In all these cases, to get the most out of it, you have to think both ways, individually and as a group to achieve the greatest synergies. Make an assessment of each player, of the group and think about the best possible strategies in diagnosing how individuals can best help the team and how the use of the team can help these individuals achieve the above objectives. Choosing the best strategies helps the team achieve that virtuous flywheel.

> I always work by measuring and analyzing data

I usually work by planning the measurement mechanisms. Sometimes it is necessary to measure in isolated conditions and others are measured during trainings sessions or matches.

Now, at [[The first AI for sports training design on acyclic sports\|Dairus]], we work with a periodic and selective evaluation system, but we want to make it automatized and in real time.

I have worked with data from:
- Physical condition
	- Tests
	- Anatomic measures
	- VO2Max
	- Hearth rates
	- Lactic acid
	- Blood analytics
	- Electrostimulation
	- Speed
	- Acceleration
	- Strength
	- Endurance
	- Flexibility
	- Training loads units
- Technic
	- Biomechanics
	- Performance
- Strategy/Tactic
	- GPS trackers
	- Relational positions
	- Ball trajectories
	- Qualitative motor situation
	- Qualitative trackers
	- Match time
	- Scoreboards
- Psychological
	- Psychological analysis
		- Arousal
		- Coping with adversity
		- Performance under pressure
		- Goal setting
		- Concentration
		- Worry management
		- Confidence and motivation
		- Coachability
